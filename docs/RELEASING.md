# Releasing

A release contains one JAR per target in `versions.json` and `manifest.json`.
The tag must match `modVersion`; for example, version `1.3.2` uses tag `v1.3.2`.

1. Bump `modVersion` in `versions.json` and finish source changes and tests.
2. Run `./gradlew :common:test buildAllVersions verifyBuilds versionTable`.
3. Check `build/distributions/manifest.json` and the JAR names against
   `versions.json`. Keep `runtimeVerified` false unless the exact version was
   exercised in Minecraft using `docs/RUNTIME_VERIFICATION.md`.
4. Commit the repaired source, manifest, and generated documentation; push the
   commit to the release branch.
5. Tag **that commit** with `v<modVersion>` and push the tag. The release workflow
   rebuilds from the tagged source and publishes those new artifacts. Never
   upload assets built from a different commit or reuse older release JARs.

The release workflow checks the tag/version match before building. A failed
build or artifact verification must stop publication. A release can report
build compatibility while still listing runtime verification as pending.
